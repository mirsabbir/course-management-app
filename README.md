# Course Management App
This project is a web-based Course Management System for a university. It allows users (staff and students) to manage and interact with courses, classes, and students in various ways. The system enables authenticated staff members to create, read, update, and delete courses, classes, and students. It also allows staff members to enroll students in courses and classes, as well as view student and class information. Students can view their enrolled courses and classes, along with other students in their classes.
